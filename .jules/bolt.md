## 2026-02-18 - Async Blocking with feedparser
**Learning:** CPU-bound libraries like `feedparser` and `BeautifulSoup` (even with `lxml`) block the asyncio event loop significantly when processing large XML/HTML content. In a FastAPI app, this can stall the entire server, making it unresponsive to health checks and other requests, even if the total processing time is short.
**Action:** Always offload such parsing to a thread pool using `await asyncio.to_thread(...)` (Python 3.9+) or `loop.run_in_executor`. This increases total wall-clock time slightly (due to GIL/overhead) but keeps the event loop responsive, which is critical for web servers.
